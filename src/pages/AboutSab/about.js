                            Hi, Sabrina Carrion here and this is my portfolio for my striking
                            career in Software Development. I am currently employed as an
                            Account Manager with a pharmaceutical software company. The role
                            has shown me the impact that the relational databases have with
                            the overall productivity of a pharmacy or clinic. With over a
                            decade of pharmaceutical technology and startup-experience, I have
                            prepared for the level of attention to detail and accuracy
                            required to execute as a Software Developer.{" "}
                        </p>{" "}
                        <p>
                            My past career as a Learning and Development Specialist positioned
                            me to collaborate with folks from the software development /app
                            IOS specific field, cyber security and data compliance.{" "}
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I discovered Software developers were always learning new
                            information and utilizing AGILE methodologies for a leaner
                            process. This is what grabbed my heart and paved a new way for a
                            great career. I believe in constantly learning and making code
                            functional and elegant.
